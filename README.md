# 3Dash-Req
**DISCLAIMER**: The 3Dash servers are **no longer** available. Read in Miscellaneous for more information.

This repo contains all of the 3Dash requests.
All of them are in Python but I originally used Insomina for testing.

# Miscellaneous
The php files use to be stored at http://delugedrop.com/3Dash, however in one of DelugeDrop's videos he stated that he will be no longer be keeping the servers alive for personal reasons and that he didn't like how 3Dash was based of a popular game.

To be honest, it's kinda sad because all of the community's creations such [I see](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DpIrLW9DLjw) and others are basically all gone. However, I do have some level data left from when I was trying to get the requests to work so I'll leave it all in a [archive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1A2VdHHBUBa6XBq01lxq9VDoZ-IHwMxkK?usp=sharing) which I will update when i get more data :)

If i ever manage to make private servers a thing I'll update this repo that includes it.
